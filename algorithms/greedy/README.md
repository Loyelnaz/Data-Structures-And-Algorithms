###Greedy
* Greedy chooses locally optimal choice at every iteration.
* For example, if the problem is to minimize the sum of elements, then an optimal choice would be to go for minimum of two elements at a given time.
* Most of the problems under this would be of finding maximum or minimum.
* In most of the problems, we would look to store the input elements, in order to find the min/max.
* Also, heap problems can be considered greedy as they too find min/max of elements.

####Note:
* In majority of the cases, greedy approach would result in an answer that is close to the correct answer.
* So, it becomes challenging to figure out when to use this approach and when to avoid it.
