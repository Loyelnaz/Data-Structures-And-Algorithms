### Stack
* Termed as LIFO, which stands for <b>Last In, First Out.</b>
* Add and remove elements from the <b>same end</b>
* It is an abstract data structure, so it can be implemented with a dynamic array
* Following operations are possible on stack:
  * pop() - remove the top item from the stack
  * push(item) - add an item to the top of the stack
  * peek() - return the top of the stack
  * isEmpty() - return true if and only if the stack is empty
* All the above operations are done in O(1) complexity
* Searching an item in the stack would take O(n) complexity

#### Implementation
* [Stack implementation using custom data structure](StackImpl.java)

#### Problems
* [Valid Parentheses](ValidParentheses.java)
