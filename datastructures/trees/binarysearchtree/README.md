###Binary Search Tree
* Type of Binary Tree
* At any given node, the data to the left of the subtree is always less than the node, and the data to the right is always greater than the node value.
* Searching, adding or removing a node from the tree would take O(logn) in average
* If the tree has only left subtree forming a straight-line, the time complexity would be O(n)
